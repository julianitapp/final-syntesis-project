<h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>
<p>
  This second part of the project must be done individual. For each plot, you
  must show evidence about your bill house public services to proof that your
  information is true.

<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    In the table we can see that in the months that are in the regression line
    are in decreasement
  </li>
  <li>
    The gray dots symbolizes the regression line, the kWh are symbolizes with
    the red dots, we also can see that the red dots are so near with the gray
    dots in the months 1,2,4,5 but in the month 3 we can see that the kWh have
    the most hight point in the table and we can analyse that in this month
    increases the kWh with around 8 points. .
  </li>
  <li>
    $$ y = -3.70 \cdot 6 + 141.90 $$ $$ y = 119.7 $$
    <th></th>
  </li>
  <li>
    The way to maintain the Kwh is to continue with the habits that are
    mantained, because in my house although we are almost neverm there, we are
    very aware of the expenses.

<h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>
<div id="analysis2Plot2"></div>
<p id="analysis2Eqn2" style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The regression line stay in very straight line in comparison with the first
    table, we only can see a little decreasement in the kWh when the members of
    the family increase
  </li>
  <li>
    When they are only 2 memebers in the family the red dots are very near to
    the gray dots, but when the members of family increase to three the results
    are very away from the regression line dots, one family having more than 200
    kWh and another family have 50 kWh so the difference are very big, and the
    both are so separated to the gray dots
  </li>
  <li>
    $$ y = -12.89 \cdot 200 + 158.62 $$ $$ y = -2419.38 $$
  </li>
  <li>
    These two variables are correlated because it have very near results but in
    this case doesnt change the regression line, because the score kWh have very
    hights and very downs in the same number of members (3) results so in formal
    ways it doesnt have a diversion.
  </li>
</ul>
