<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
  In this part you are going to work as a group to find information about the
  main concepts of this project

  <h5>
    Electric Energy
  </h5>
  <p>
    Electric energy is the energy derived from electric potential energy or
    kinetic energy of the charged particles. In general, it is refer to as the
    energy that has been converted from electric potential energy.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example: <br />
    - Batteries (direct current) <br />
    - Outlets (alternating current) <br />
    - Electrical appliances (toasters, vacuum cleaners, lamps, refrigerators,
    blenders, computers) <br />
    - Battery-operated appliances (cell phones, flash lights, cameras) <br />
    - Solar cells. <br />
    - Wind turbines. <br />
    - Lightning. <br />
    - Electric eels. <br />

  <h5>Watts</h5>
  <p>
    The watt is used to specify the rate at which electrical energy
    isdissipated, or the rate at which electromagnetic energy is radiated,
    absorbed, or dissipated.
  </p>
  <h5>Scartter plot</h5>
  <p>
    Scartter plot uses dots to represent values for two different numeric
    variables. The position of each dot on the horizontal and vertical axis
    indicates values for an individual data point. Scatter plots are used to
    observe relationships between variables. <br />

    There are three types of scatter plots or charts: U-shaped, linear and
    exponential. These are the three most important ones: positive, negative, or
    no correlation.
