<h3>Introduction</h3>

  <h5>
    Electric Energy
  </h5>
  <p>
    Electric energy is the energy derived from electric potential energy or
    kinetic energy of the charged particles. In general, it is refer to as the
    energy that has been converted from electric potential energy.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example: <br />
    - Batteries (direct current) <br />
    - Outlets (alternating current) <br />
    - Electrical appliances (toasters, vacuum cleaners, lamps, refrigerators,
    blenders, computers) <br />
    - Battery-operated appliances (cell phones, flash lights, cameras) <br />
    - Solar cells. <br />
    - Wind turbines. <br />
    - Lightning. <br />
    - Electric eels. <br />

  <h5>Watts</h5>
  <p>
    The watt is used to specify the rate at which electrical energy
    isdissipated, or the rate at which electromagnetic energy is radiated,
    absorbed, or dissipated.

  <h5>Scartter plot</h5>
  <p>
    Scartter plot uses dots to represent values for two different numeric
    variables. The position of each dot on the horizontal and vertical axis
    indicates values for an individual data point. Scatter plots are used to
    observe relationships between variables. <br />

    There are three types of scatter plots or charts: U-shaped, linear and
    exponential. These are the three most important ones: positive, negative, or
    no correlation.

    Linear regression
  </h6>
  <p>
    Linear regression analysis is used to predict the value of a variable based
    on the value of another variable. The variable you want to predict is called
    the dependent variable.The variable you are using to predict the other
    variable's value is called the independent variable. for example, the weight
    of the person is linearly related to their height. So, this shows a linear
    relationship between the height and weight of the person. According to this,
    as we increase the height, the weight of the person will also increase.

  <h6>Renewable energy</h6>
  <p>
    Renewable energy is energy derived from natural sources that are replenished
    at a higher rate than they are consumed. Sunlight and wind, for example, are
    such sources that are constantly being replenished. Renewable energy sources
    are plentiful and all around us. Generating renewable energy creates far
    lower emissions than burning fossil fuels. Transitioning from fossil fuels,
    which currently account for the lionâ€™s share of emissions, to renewable
    energy is key to addressing the climate crisis.<br />
    Renewables are now cheaper in most countries, and generate three times more
    jobs than fossil fuels. The most popular renewable energy sources currently
    are:<br />
    - Solar energy.<br />
    - Wind energy.<br />
    - Hydro energy.<br />
    - Tidal energy.<br />
    - Geothermal energy.<br />
    - Biomass energy.<br />
