<h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>

<div id="analysis1Plot1"></div>
<p id="analysis1Eqn1" style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    In the table we can see that in the months that are in the regression line
    are increasing .
  </li>
  <li>
    The gray dots symbolizes the regression line, the kWh are symbolizes with
    the red dots, we also can see that the red dots are so near with the gray
    dots in the months 1,2,4,5, but in the month 3 we can see that are a very
    big increasement with more than 20 kWh.
  </li>
  <li>
    $$ y = -5.20 \cdot 6 + 139.20 $$ $$ y = 108 $$
  </li>
  <li>
    In the house we can reduce the kWh expeneses by making ourselves aware of
    the enviroment and leaving aside the use of electronic devices connected to
    light for so long.
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>

<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The statistical datas that are in the regression line are in a continuos
    increase .
  </li>
  <li>
    All the red dots are so near to the gray dots, except the familys with 5
    members that have they khW under 100 KhW more that the dots in the
    regression line,on average all the points are.
  </li>
  <li>
    $$ y = 69.92 \cdot 200 - 118.97 $$ $$ y = 13865.03 $$
  </li>
  <li>
    These two variables are correlated, because it have very near results but it
    doesnt have a diversion so the regression line is a diagonal straight.
  </li>
</ul>
